# SharedSecuredServices

SharedSecuredServices is a repository that contains the source code for a collection of shared and secured services commonly used in web applications. These services are designed to provide common functionality related to authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, and more.

The repository includes the following services:

1. **Authentication Service**: This service handles user authentication and provides functionality for user registration, login, logout, and password reset.

2. **Authorization Service**: The authorization service is responsible for managing user roles and permissions. It provides an interface to define roles and assign permissions to those roles.

3. **Logging Service**: The logging service offers a centralized logging mechanism for the application. It allows logging of various types of events, such as errors, warnings, and informational messages.

4. **Error Handling Service**: The error handling service provides a standardized way to handle and process errors in the application. It includes error logging, error reporting, and customizable error messages.

5. **Caching Service**: The caching service allows for efficient storage and retrieval of frequently accessed data. It utilizes a cache store to store data in memory, reducing the need for repeated database or API calls.

6. **Email Service**: The email service enables sending transactional emails from the application. It provides an interface to compose and send emails, including features like email templates, attachments, and SMTP configuration.

7. **File Storage Service**: The file storage service provides functionality to store and retrieve files in a secure and scalable manner. It abstracts the underlying file storage system, allowing for easy switching between different storage providers.
